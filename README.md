# EVERY WEEK

This a group of cool projects I did (almost) every week to learn new technologies




Here's information on some of the projects

<br>
<br>

# 8-ASCII Camera
This takes in the information from the camera (using ```cv2```) and transforms it into ASCII art, realtime. (check out [this repo where I improved the cam and added some features](https://github.com/korrectional/ASCII-Camera))
### To run: ```python main.py```
### Used libraries: ```cv2, os```

# 9-Door Movement Alarm
Little script for arduino device that plays a little alarm/ringtone each time someone opens/closes the door. This one was fun

# 10-Operating System Kernel
Small kernel. 2 years ago I tried to do that and I failed, this is my comeback. This one only prints 'The KERNEL has arrived' into video memory. I plan to continue this project in its own repo

# 11-Local Cloud
A couple small shell scripts I wrote as a local substitute to git while working on the week 10 project. While this was in the same week as the previous, I felt that I haven't had EW projects for so much time that I needed to drop 2 at once. The way it works is from a device you can either override the project version in the server or get the server version of the project. This allows to seamelessly work in a project in the same network with different devices. Nothing special really. Don't forget to create a .env file to store the password and adress of the server device.
