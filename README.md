# 8-ASCII Camera
This takes in the information from the camera (using ```cv2```) and transforms it into ASCII art, realtime. (check out [this repo where I improved the cam and added some features](https://github.com/korrectional/ASCII-Camera))
### To run: ```python main.py```
### Used libraries: ```cv2, os```

# 9-Door Movement Alarm
